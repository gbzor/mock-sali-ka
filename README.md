# Sali Ka — Community Events Web App

**Sali Ka** ("come along / join in") is a community events discovery web app. Browse
what's happening around your neighborhood, RSVP, host your own events, and check
members in with a membership QR — all from a clean, Apple-inspired desktop
interface.

This project is a **front-end web adaptation** of a mobile app UI design. The
original nine mobile screens have been re-composed into a responsive desktop web
app with a hovering, glassmorphic navigation bar and multi-column layouts, while
keeping the same two-tone warm palette (cream surfaces + emerald green accent) and
Nunito typography.

> Front-end demo only — it runs entirely in the browser on local sample data.
> There is no backend, no authentication, and no external API calls.

## Features

- **Home feed** — greeting header, live category filtering (All / Market / Music /
  Sports / Volunteer), a hosted-event banner, and a responsive grid of event cards.
- **Schedule** — an interactive August 2026 month calendar with event markers and a
  day-by-day agenda.
- **Explore** — a stylized map with event pins and a synced list of nearby events.
- **Post an Event** — a validated create-event form with category picker, promote
  toggle, and a success state.
- **Event detail** — cover, date/location info card, social proof, description, and
  an RSVP action.
- **Profile** — identity card, membership QR, attendee/organizer segmented view, and
  quick links to organizer tools.
- **Organizer tools** — QR check-in scanner (animated) and a full attendance roster
  with live counts.
- **Settings** — grouped account, notification, preference, and support rows with
  working toggles.
- **Responsive** — adapts from wide desktop down to mobile, with a collapsing menu.
- **Accessible** — semantic markup, ARIA roles/labels, visible focus states, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

## Tech Stack

| Layer      | Choice                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework  | [React 18](https://react.dev)                      |
| Language   | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (strict) |
| Build tool | [Vite](https://vite.dev)                           |
| Icons      | [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev) (line SVG icons)|
| Styling    | Plain CSS with design tokens (CSS custom properties)|
| Font       | [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) |
| Hosting    | [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (static, free Hobby tier) |

No CSS framework, no runtime UI library — the styling is a small, self-contained
design system so the bundle stays lean (~54 KB gzipped JS).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm** (check with `node -v` and `npm -v`)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gbzor/mock-sali-ka.git
cd mock-sali-ka

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. (Optional) create your local env file — not required to run the demo
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (default `http://localhost:5173`).

### Available Scripts

| Command           | What it does                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Start the Vite dev server with hot reload           |
| `npm run build`   | Type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) then build to `dist/`   |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally                  |
| `npm run lint`    | Type-check only                                     |

## Usage Guide

- Use the **top navigation bar** to move between Home, Schedule, Explore, and Profile.
- On **Home**, click a category pill to filter, or type in the search box to filter
  by title/location. Click any event card to open its detail page.
- Click **Post an Event** (top right) to open the create-event form.
- On **Profile**, open **Check-in Scanner** or **Attendance** to see the organizer
  tools, and **Settings** for account preferences.

## Deployment (Vercel — free)

This is a purely static site, so it deploys on Vercel's **free Hobby tier** with no
server functions and therefore no runtime compute cost.

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, **Add New → Project** and import the repository.
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite. Defaults are correct:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
4. Click **Deploy**.

`vercel.json` already sets the framework, SPA rewrites, and security headers.

## Security Notes

Security was treated as a requirement, not an afterthought:

- **No secrets in the codebase.** The app needs none to run. `.env` files are
  git-ignored; only `.env.example` (safe placeholders) is committed. Remember: any
  Vite variable prefixed with `VITE_` is shipped to the browser and is therefore
  **public** — never put private/server secrets there.
- **No injection surface.** No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no `eval`, no direct DOM
  HTML writes. All rendered text is React-escaped sample data.
- **Security headers** (set in `vercel.json`): a strict `Content-Security-Policy`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` /
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking protection), `Referrer-Policy`,
  a locked-down `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geolocation disabled), and HSTS.
- **No third-party trackers or analytics.** The only external origin is Google Fonts
  (stylesheet + font files), which is explicitly allowed in the CSP.
- **Source maps disabled** in the production build so source is not exposed.
- **Dependencies:** `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

If you extend this into a full-stack app, keep all authentication, database
credentials, and private API keys on the server side — never in client code or
`VITE_`-prefixed variables.

## Environment Variables

The demo requires **no** environment variables. The placeholders in `.env.example`
exist only for when you wire the UI to a real backend:

| Variable              | Description                                    | Example                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`   | Base URL of your public events API             | `https://api.example.com`     |
| `VITE_MAP_PUBLIC_KEY` | Public, domain-restricted map/geocoding key    | `your_public_map_key_here`    |
